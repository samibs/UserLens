# UserLens Product Context

## Problem Statement
Creating end-user documentation is a time-consuming process that often becomes outdated as applications evolve. Developers focus on code documentation but neglect user-facing documentation. Traditional documentation tools require manual effort and don't understand the semantic meaning of UI components from a user's perspective.

## Solution
UserLens bridges this gap by automatically analyzing frontend code to generate user-centered documentation. It extracts the semantic meaning of components, identifies common UI patterns, and creates documentation that explains how to use the application from the user's perspective.

## Value Proposition
1. **Save Development Time**: Automatically generate user documentation without additional effort.
2. **Improve User Experience**: Provide clear, consistent documentation for application users.
3. **Maintain Documentation Accuracy**: Keep documentation in sync with code changes.
4. **Enhance Onboarding**: Help new users understand how to use the application quickly.
